Probably the most intelligent stickman to grace your browser.

This simulation is a neuroevolution project that uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm — implemented via the neataptic.js library — to evolve 24 parallel populations of stick figures learning different locomotion styles.

No dependencies or installation required; each simulator runs directly from a modern browser as a local HTML file.

## Simulators
- `WalkingSimulator.html` — pure ragdoll gait evolution.
- `RunningSimulator.html` — NEAT stickman with feet and hands tuned for running.
- `JetpackSimulator.html` — NEAT stickman that learns to fly and land on a pedestal target.
