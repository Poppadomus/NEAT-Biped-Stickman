Probably the most intelligent stickman to grace your browser.

This simulation is a neuroevolution project that uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm — implemented via the neataptic.js library — to evolve 24 parallel populations of stick figures learning different locomotion styles.

No dependencies or installation required; each simulator runs directly from a modern browser as a local HTML file.
