Probably the most intelligent stickman to grace your browser.

This simulation is a neuroevolution simulation that uses the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm — implemented via the neataptic.js library — to evolve 24 parallel populations of stick figures learning to walk, run, or fly with a jetpack.

No dependencies or installation required runs straight from any modern browser as a local html file.

## Simulators

- `WalkingSimulator.html` – broad-ragdoll walking evolution.
- `RunningSimulator.html` – speed-focused running evolution.
- `JetpackSimulator.html` – aerial control evolution with jet-assisted thrust.
